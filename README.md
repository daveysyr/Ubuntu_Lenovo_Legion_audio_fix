# Ubuntu_Lenovo_Legion_audio_fix
This is what worked for me to get the audio working with Ubuntu 24.10 on a Lenovo Legion Pro 7 16IRX9H Intel® Core™ i9-14900HX × 32

The output is from a few hours of trying various things via Chat GPT and finally getting it all working.

Finally, once the fix is applied, the first boot seems to take a couple of minutes.  Subsequent boots are much faster.

You should have boot sound after the fix and also audio from Firefox/VLC/etc should work OK.
